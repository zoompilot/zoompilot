The user's say over the Jetlink setting, shared by the mici and tici models panels:
Off, USB (a Jetson, a Linux PC or a Mac) or iOS (an iPhone), stored as an
index into the adapter's MODES. The small model is picked as ever: manager
runs whichever modeld that bundle needs and the link joins it, so the setting
never changes which modeld runs. Everything else here reads ui_state.jetlink,
the snapshot the params pass takes, and what the models panels say of the big
models jetlink runs.
